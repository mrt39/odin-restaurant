# odin-restaurant
Restaurant assignment for the odin project.

Main purpose is to practice using Webpack and its many utilities. 

Also, this project stands as an example of the usage of tabbed browsing(browsing multiple web pages in a single window) and ES6 modules (i.e. connecting multiple js files with imports and exports).
