# odin-restaurant
Restaurant assignment for the odin project.

Main purpose is to practice using Webpack and its many utilities. 

Also, this project stands as an example of the usage of tabbed browsing(browsing multiple web pages in a single window) and ES6 modules (i.e. connecting multiple js files with imports and exports).


Hosting the completed page is done on the branch (https://github.com/mrt39/odin-restaurant/tree/gh-pages) because as we are using webpack, the full bundled version of the site is available in the dist folder, but GH pages is looking for an index.html in the root directory of your project. So I followed the guide here (https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490#step-1) to upload the dist file individually as a branch and host the completed page there.
